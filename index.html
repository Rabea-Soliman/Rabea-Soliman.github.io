                            HTML 5 (formerly and commonly spelled HTML5[a]) is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup based pattern to it.

                            HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard, and subsumes XHTML. It currently exists in two standardized forms: HTML 5.2 Recommendation[4] by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, a broad coalition of organizations), intended primarily for Web content developers; and HTML Living Standard[5] by WHATWG (a small consortium of four browser vendors), intended primarily for browser developers, though it also exists in an abridged Web developer version.[6] There are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications.

                            HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[7] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][8] Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML 5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML;[9] the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018.[10]

                        The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[13] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.[14]
